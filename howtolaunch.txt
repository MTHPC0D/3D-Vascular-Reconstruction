HOW TO INSTALL AND LAUNCH THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
================================================

Prerequisites:
- Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system

Installation Steps:
1. Open Anaconda Prompt or Terminal
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd "c:\dev\PythonProject\MedicalProject\3D-Vascular-Reconstruction"

3. Create the environment from the YAML file:
   conda env create -f environment.yml

4. Activate the environment:
   conda activate MedEnv

5. Verify installation:
   conda list

To use the environment:
- Always activate before running the project: conda activate MedEnv
- To deactivate: conda deactivate
- To remove environment: conda env remove -n MedEnv

Troubleshooting:
- If installation fails, try: conda clean --all
- For channel conflicts, use: conda config --set channel_priority flexible
- Update conda: conda update conda

The environment includes all necessary packages for 3D vascular reconstruction including:
- VTK, VMTK for medical image processing
- Open3D for 3D data processing  
- SimpleITK for medical imaging
- Matplotlib, Plotly for visualization
- CustomTkinter for GUI applications
